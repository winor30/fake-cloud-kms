# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Use GitHub Security Advisories to submit a private report.
- If Security Advisories are unavailable, contact the maintainer via the email listed in the GitHub profile with enough detail to reproduce the issue (steps, affected version, environment, expected/actual behavior, and impact).
- Do not include real secrets or production data in any report.

## Expectations and Scope
- This is a personal OSS emulator provided on a best-effort basis. There is no SLA, and fixes are not guaranteed.
- Only the latest `main` branch and most recent release are considered; forks and older versions are out of scope.
- The emulator is not intended for production or handling real key material; never load real secrets.

## Triage and Disclosure
- Reports will be acknowledged on a best-effort basis; high-risk issues (auth bypass, privilege escalation, data/key disclosure) are prioritized. Low-risk issues may be delayed or closed.
- If a fix is prepared, coordinated disclosure is preferred; timelines are negotiated case by case on a best-effort basis.
- No response or remediation timeline is guaranteed.

## Disclaimer
- This software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The author is not liable for any damages or losses arising from its use.
